# REST version of Spring PetClinic Sample Application

This project is based on [spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest).  I am 
using this project as a way to familiarize myself with Spring Boot.  It is not meant for general consumption. 

For specific set up details, please see the [spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest) 
README. After reviewing and setting up your environment according to the source project's README, do the following to clone and run this project:

## Running petclinic locally
```
	git clone https://github.com/trojas/spring-petclinic-rest.git
	cd spring-petclinic-rest
	./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:9966/petclinic/
